# OpenLibre
The OpenLibre app for Android can be used to read the tissue glucose measurement data from the FreeStyle Libre CGM device using a NFC capable phone.

Its allows users to see the current tissue glucose level as well as an estimation of the current blood glucose level based on the tissue glucose levels from the past 15 minutes.
Historic data is visualized graphically in a plot.

Further, the data can be uploaded by the user to their online account at [Tidepool](http://tidepool.org/) for more comprehensive data visualization in combination with data from other devices.

All data can also be exported to the phone's memory in JSON and CSV formats.


## Privacy
By default the data read from the sensor is only stored locally on the phone.
Only when explicitly specified by the user, the data will be uploaded to the servers of the open-source project Tidepool.
And crash reports will on be sent to the author of this app after manual confirmation by the user.

## Building
The app depends on the [TidepoolAPILib](https://github.com/DorianScholz/TidepoolAPILib).

1. Clone the TidepoolAPILib repo into the same parent directory as the OpenLibre repo, e.g.:
- ~/src/OpenLibre
- ~/src/TidepoolAPILib

2. Then build the TidepoolAPILib using Andorid Studio so the AAR is generated:
- ~/src/TidepoolAPILib/tidepool-api-lib/build/outputs/aar/tidepool-api-lib-debug.aar

3. Finally build the OpenLibre app using Android Studio to produce the APK
